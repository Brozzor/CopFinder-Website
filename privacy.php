                                data on a secure server behind a firewall.<br /><br />Payment:<br />If you choose a
                                direct
                                payment gateway to complete your purchase, then STRIPE stores your credit card data. It

                                SERVICES<br /><br />In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
                                use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the
                                services they provide to us.<br />However, certain third-party service providers, such
                                as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy

                                located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the
                                United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be
